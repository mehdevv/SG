{
  role: "admin",
  email: "admin@example.com",
  createdAt: "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z"
}
```

#### `quests` Collection
```javascript
// Document ID: [auto_generated]
{
  name: "Quest Name",
  description: "Quest description",
  xpReward: 100,
  coinsReward: 50,
  assignedPlayer: "player_uid" | null, // null for all players
  endTime: "2024-01-02T00:00:00.000Z",
  verificationName: "Screenshot",
  verificationLink: "https://example.com",
  status: "active",
  createdAt: "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z",
  updatedAt: "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z"
}
```

### 2. Firestore Security Rules
Update your Firestore rules:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Admin access
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && 
        get(/databases/$(database)/documents/admin_users/$(request.auth.uid)).data.role == 'admin';
    }
    
    // Regular user access to their own data
    match /users/{userId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
    
    // Public read access to quests
    match /quests/{questId} {
      allow read: if true;
      allow write: if request.auth != null && 
        get(/databases/$(database)/documents/admin_users/$(request.auth.uid)).data.role == 'admin';
    }
  }
}
```

### 3. Create Admin User
1. Go to Firebase Authentication
2. Create a new user with email/password
3. Copy the user's UID
4. In Firestore, create a document in `admin_users` collection with the UID as document ID
5. Set the document data:
   ```javascript
   {
     role: "admin",
     adminfaouzi@gmail.com: "your-admin-email@example.com",
     createdAt: new Date().toISOString()
   }
   ```
